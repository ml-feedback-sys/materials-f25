# Assignments during paper presentations

The schedule of paper presentations is [here](https://github.com/ml-feedback-sys/materials-f25/blob/main/calendar.md).

These assignments are due EOD on
- October 30, 2023 -- for papers presented 10/28 or 10/30
- November 6, 2023 -- for papers presented 11/4 or 11/6
- November 13, 2023 -- for papers presented 11/11 or 11/13
- (your [project update](https://github.com/ml-feedback-sys/materials-f25/blob/main/project.md#midterm-update) is due as a pdf in `project/groupname/` submitted in a PR titled "Project Update - Name1, netID1; Name2, netID2; ..." on November 14)
- November 20, 2023 -- for papers presented 11/18 or 11/20
- December 4, 2023 -- for papers presented 11/25, 12/2, or 12/4

Though the due date is after the presentations, you are encouraged to begin working on assignments *prior* to the presentations,
so that you can actively participate during class.
Note that you will also be assessed on participation (10% of your final grade) during the presentations of your peers.

Requirements: Each week, submit a PR for at least one of the following options. 

To submit the assignment, you will [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) (PR) with the main collaborative repository.
Please title the PR "`DATE` Submission - `Name`, `netID`" and include your materials your folder (`submission/netID`).

**If you use a generative AI tool for these assignments**: Include a section in your writeup called "GenAI Usage" where you explain your process. 
Also identify a weakness of the genAI tool and explain how you added additional value on top of the generated outputs. 
(If you struggle to do this, that's a hint that you aren't engaging deeply enough with the material.)
This section should be about one paragraph (100 words).

## Option 1: Literature deep dive

Select one paper to read in detail. 
Identify one key prior work (cited by the paper) and one key follow-up work (which cites the paper).
For identifying follow-up works, you can use search tools like Google Scholar or Semantic Scholar.
If there is no closely related piece of follow up work, identify two key pieces of prior work instead.

Use these three papers to synthesize a discussion about how this paper fits into a broader line of research.
How did the paper build upon or extend prior work? 
What open questions or limitations of the paper have been addressed by follow-up work?
Do you see other research questions along this line that are still unaddressed?

This discussion should be about one page (500 words) of writing included 
in you PR as a markdown or PDF file. 
A suggested format is to 1) summarize the paper and its contributions, 2) discuss its connection to the key piece of prior work, 3) discussion its connection to the key piece of follow-up work, and then 4) a conclusion highlighting promising areas for future research.

## Option 2: Implementation deep dive

Select one paper to read in detail. 
Identify an element that can be investigated in code: e.g. a simple simulation of a proposed model, an implementation of an algorithm, etc.
If there is code available for the paper (check the author's websites and GitHub), 
you are encouraged to use it as a starting point, but you are expected to extend some aspect of it.

Implement or extend your chosen element, and use this to investigate the paper's claims.
E.g., does the simulation match the theoretical characterization?
Does the algorithm work as promised?
How robust are the findings to different parameter settings?

Include your code in and report the findings of your investigation in your PR.
Include at least one figure or table to visualize your findings.

## Option 3: Theory deep dive

Select one paper to read in detail.
Identify a key analysis tool or technique that the paper makes use of for its theoretical results.
How is this technique used? 
Are there other general problems that this this technique is useful for?
How does this technique connect to ideas that we covered in lecture?

Write up a short tutorial about the technique (about a page, 3-500 words) addressing the questions above.
Include the tutorial as a markdown or PDF file.

## Option 4: Presenter

If you present during the week in question, you may select this option.
Please include your slides as a PDF in your PR.
