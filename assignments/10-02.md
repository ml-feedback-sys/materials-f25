# Week of October 2
Both parts of this assignment are required and due EOD on Friday, October 10.

## Task 1: Sign up for paper presentations

Starting in late October, classes will consist of paper presentations given by students.
You are responsible for signing up for one paper and one time slot. 
A list of paper options will be posted [here](https://github.com/ml-feedback-sys/materials-f25/blob/main/presentation.md) by Tuesday 10/7.
We will spend a few minutes during lecture on Thursday 10/9 for sign-ups, which will occur on a first come, first serve basis.

You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with the options ahead class on Thursday.
You are responsible for coordinating with other students if you find that you are unavailable during the only open timeslots.
The presentation schedule must be finalized by Friday 10/10.

## Task 2: Project proposal

A one page project proposal is due on Friday 10/10.
Please see [this page](https://github.com/ml-feedback-sys/materials-f25/blob/main/project.md#proposal) for details.

To submit your project proposal, one member of your group should [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) (PR).
Please title the PR "Project Proposal - Name1, netID1; Name2, netID2; ...".
